       <h2>About me</h2>
       <p>Wakhungu is a budding developer with a keen interest in mobile software development. This is the <em>first time</em> I am designing a website and I trust it will come out well, however basic.</p> 
       <p>Outside the development space, I also write about fitness though I have slacked off a bit recently; I mean learning how to code is a full-time endeavor. All the same, check this link<a href="https://www.essdoubleyou.com"></a> and tell me what you think. DM me via LinkedIn<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-wakhungu/"></a>.</p>
       <p>I must say though that my natural-born (and cultured) talent is in fine art. Check out my portfolio of artwork here and tell me what you think about it <a href="https://www.essdoubleyou.com/shop"></a> Of course the next portfolio you will be seeing associated with the name Wakhungu will be one of software development projects, both personal and professional. With this in mind, I hope to collaborate with you so that we find solutions to everyday problems. Walk with me.</p>
